# IBPSA Project 1 Expert Meeting in Berlin

**DRAFT**

On February 27 and 28, 2018, the IBPSA Project 1 held its first Expert Meeting at the UdK Berlin, hosted by Christoph Nytsch-Geusen.
The meeting was attended by 60 people. The main focus of meeting was to organize the work
within and the dependencies among the work packages. There was also a
well received keynote by Hubertus Tummescheit,
Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder of Modelon,
about "The Adoption of MPC in the Power Industry â€“ Lessons Learned and Ideas for the Buildings Industry".

During the meeting, the following work was prioritized for the work packages.
While detailed plans may change during the 5 year project duration,
the listing gives an overview about the main priorities.

## WP 1.1: Modelica Library for Design and Operation

The focus will be to develop a validated, well-documented Modelica library
for the design and operation of building and district energy systems. This will be
accomplished by further developing https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa, expanding
its scope and documentation, and restructuring the library for easier use by non-expert.

The goal is to create a library that will serve as the basis of user-focused distributions
of Modelica libraries for the building energy domain, in particular the libraries
AixLib (RWTH Aachen), Buildings (LBNL), BuildingSystems (UdK Berlin) and IDEAS (KU Leuven)
that use the IBPSA library as their core. Furthermore, a goal is that such libraries
will be included in building energy simulation programs, including but not limited to EnergyPlus.

## WP 1.2: Model Predictive Control

Lieve

## WP 2.1 City District Information Modeling

The focus here is on improving the efficiency and reducing the uncertainty of urban energy simulation workflows. Key subtasks include: (i) international data mapping: defining the task-dependent data needs of urban energy simulation software, the existence and - for this is often different - availability of data, and strategies to plug the gaps between what is needed and what is available; (ii) international archetype mapping: defining country-specific domestic and non-domestic building archetypes and associated age bands, to support the semantic attribution of 3D models for urban energy simulation. Likewise, the development of classification techniques to automate the assignment of archetypes and age bands using geospatial data; (iii) parsimonious geometric processing: better understanding the appropriate level of geometric complexity needed for urban energy simulation purposes, and developing and deploying strategies to reduce geometric model complexity to these apporpriate levels; (iv) parsimonious semantic enrichment: (semi-)autmated workflows for the acquisition, sanitation and assignment of attributes to 3D models; (v) data exchange, using CityGML and its related application domain extensions (ADEs); (vi) demonstration of the capabilities of urban energy simulation software.
