## Breakout session 1-1

### Presentation Krzysztof

**TERMONET Project**
- Model predictive control for special configuration of thermal network with boreholes
- Important to control on district level to avoid too low temperatures in network, decreasing COP of heat pumps
- Compare individual MPC to distributed
- Optimization using
  - Multiple shooting
  - Genetic algorithm

### Presentation Ina

**Status of PhD work**
- Overview of previous work
  - Comparison of different levels of detail
  - Deterministic data enrichment using TABULA/TEASER
- Next steps
  - Probabilistic data enrichment using EPC database
  - (un)supervised learning and quantile regression model
  - Correlation between predicted values (U-values)

## Breakout session 1-2

### Presentation Bram

**Neighbourhood heat load aggregation**
(collab with Ina and Annelies)
- Used for design optimization of District Energy Systems, focus on storage sizing
- Using deterministic heat load profiles
  - Reduce complexity, but not accuracy
- Compare individual simulation of all buildings to archetype simulation with scaling
  - Detailed models: white box IDEAS models
  - Reduced order models: TEASER four-element models
- Peak heating demand represented very well, but lower powers show some difference
- Annual energy use is approximated very well
- Discussion on generation of "typical" comfort set-points for archetype simulation, including simpler method to reduce computation time (10x speed-up)
