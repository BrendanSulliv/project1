Structure and Management of the Project
=======================================

As of August 1, 2018,
there are currently 27 organizational participants,
2 sponsoring participants, and 30 individual participants.
A full list of the participants can be found at
https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/participation.html.


Progress of the activities
==========================

Task 1: Modelica
----------------

WP 1.1: Library for design and operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The former IEA Annex 60 library has been renamed to
*IBPSA Library* and is posted under a BSD license at
https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa

The development is actively ongoing, with monthly coordination
meeting and an upcoming release 2.0.0, to be scheduled
for September.
A main addition this year are models for
 * heat pumps
 * glycol solution with user-specified mass fraction,
 * borefields (under development)

Also ongoing is the development of an I/O block
that allows reading and overwriting signals
through a web request. This is needed
for the *BOPTEST* emulator that is developed
in WP 1.2

WP 1.2: Library for Model Predictive Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main activity was focused on the initiation
of  a
Building Optimization Performance Test framework (BOPTEST).
BOPTEST will allow testing of advanced control sequences
on a range of models that emulate the response
of the building and HVAC system.
The development of the testing infrastucture, and
of emulators for different types of buildings and HVAC systems,
is ongoing.

A journal paper about effect of model accuracy
on the performance of MPC has been developed
and submitted to a journal.



Task 2: Building and City Quarter Information Models
----------------------------------------------------

WP 2.1: City Quarter Information Modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

xxx

WP 2.2: Building Information Modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

xxxx

Task 3: Application and Dissemination
-------------------------------------

WP 3.1 Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

xxxx

WP 3.2 Dissemination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project 1 will be presented at the 2018
Building Performance Analysis Conference and SimBuild,
which is co-organized by ASHRAE and IBPSA-USA,
on September 26-28, 2018.

A journal paper about effect of model accuracy
on the performance of MPC has been submitted to a journal.
